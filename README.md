# TaskTracker

A User has a Name, Email and a Manager.
The user selects their manager from a dropdown during registration and can be edited later from the Profile Page.
A user can create a task, assigned or unassigned.
If this task is unassigned, it gets added to the unassigned tasks section.
Only a manager can assign tasks to their underlings.
